 * Description
 * ImageStreamTag represents an Image that is retrieved by tag name from an ImageStream. Use this resource to interact
 * with the tags and images in an image stream by tag, or to see the image details for a particular tag. The image
 * associated with this resource is the most recently successfully tagged, imported, or pushed image (as described
 * in the image stream status.tags.items list for this tag). If an import is in progress or has failed the previous
 * image will be shown. Deleting an image stream tag clears both the status and spec fields of an image stream.
 * If no image can be retrieved for a given tag, a not found error will be returned.
